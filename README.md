# Predicting Strength of High-Performance Concrete Using Artificial Neural Network
    Artificial Neural Network with
        Single hidden layer
        Batch mode of training
        Log sigmoid transfer functions

## Transfer function:
    Input Layer:
        Log-sigmoid transfer function
    Hidden Layer:
        Log-sigmoid transfer function

## Input Parameters:
    Input Neurons = no. of independent variables
    Output Neurons = no. of dependent variables
    Training Patterns = no. of training patterns to be used (should not be more that in data_training.csv)
    Testing Patterns = no. of testing patterns to be used (should not be more that in data_testing.csv)

## Model Parameters:
    Hidden Neurons = no. of neurons in hidden layer
    Learning Rate
    Momentum Coefficient
    Accuracy/Error
